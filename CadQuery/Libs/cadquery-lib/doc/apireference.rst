CadQuery API Reference
***********************



.. seealso::
  This page lists api methods grouped by functional area.
  Use :ref:`classreference` to see methods alphabetically by class.

Primary Objects
----------------

The CadQuery API is made up of 3 main objects:

* **CQ** -  Basic Selection, and 3d operations
* **Workplane** -- Draw in 2-d to make 3d features
* **Selector** -- Filter and select things

The sections below list methods of these objects grouped by **functional area**
