## Introduction

This is a FreeCAD module (aka workbench) that adds elements like a CadQuery code editor. All of the required libraries are embedded with the workbench, and so it is probably the fastest way to get up and running with CadQuery on a local computer. For users who just want to try CadQuery without installing anything, the [CadQuery Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RustyVermeer/tryCQ/master) might be a better choice.
